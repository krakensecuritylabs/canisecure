## Signing in

Check the address bar when you sign in!

**If the URL that appears in the address bar when you sign in doesn't include login.live.com, you could be on a phishing site. Don't enter your password. Quit, restart your browser and navigate to Outlook.com again. If the problem continues, check your computer for viruses.**

## Use a strong password
As with everything, make sure you use a [strong unique password](/guides/passwords/) for your email account.

## Use 2-Step Verification
- Go to the [Security basics](https://account.microsoft.com/security) page and sign in with your Microsoft account.
- Select More security options.
- Under Two-step verification, choose Set up two-step verification to turn it on.
- Follow the instructions.

Note: As part of setting up this account, you’ll be given a QR code to scan with your device; this is one way we ensure you are in physical possession of the device you are installing the Authenticator app to.
 
## Remove Recovery phone/email

Don’t use a recovery phone or email. If an attacker steals your mobile number through a SIM swaps or gets access to your recovery email, they can use it to get access to your Microsoft account through this recovery function.

## Sign in Settings

Avoid saving passwords to your Microsoft account and using it as password manager. Avoid signing in with Microsoft. Rely on a separate password manager instead.
