## What to remember when you use two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication significantly improves the security of your Apple ID. After you turn it on, signing into your account will require both your password and access to your trusted devices or trusted phone number. To keep your account as secure as possible and help ensure you never lose access, there are a few simple guidelines you should follow: 

- Remember your Apple ID password.
- Use a device passcode on all your devices.
- Keep your trusted phone number(s) up to date.
- Keep your trusted devices physically secure.

## Sign in Settings

Avoid saving passwords to your apple account and using it as password manager. Avoid signing in with your Apple account. Rely on a separate password manager instead.
