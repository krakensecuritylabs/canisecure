## Consider Deleting your Facebook

If are you aren't actively using your Facebook, the easiest way to protect yourself is to [temporarily deactivate or permanently delete your account](https://www.facebook.com/deactivate_delete_account/).

## See what the public can see about you

It's common that anyone with a Facebook account (i.e., a Facebook user that isn't a friend or friend of friend) can view your photos, friends, tagged locations and things that you have liked. Check to see what your profile looks like to the public by [using Facebook's "View As" feature](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=timeline).

As with any application, you should also do the following:

-   Remove your mobile phone number. With a SIM swapping attack, it might be possible for an attacker to get access to your Facebook account.
-   Use two-factor authentication
-   Use a [strong, unique password](/guides/passwords)
